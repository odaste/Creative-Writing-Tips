  Character Tips
  </h1>
    <p>
    One of the most important aspects of creating a story, is creating the characters. Although a story might be driven by its plot, it is also important not to forget about its characters as they make a plot believable and often drives it forward.
    <br>
    That is why, after plot, you should spend a fair amount of time developing believable characters. To be able to make such characters, it is a good idea to simply go to a caf√©, or sit on a bench, and watch people - how do they act, how are their conversations?
